===========

Visualization of partisanship in Congress (originally built for Harvard's CS109 Data Science).

-----------

This project requires a basic HTTP server (because of the same-origin policy). This will do:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8008
```

The visualization will then be reachable at [http://localhost:8008/](http://localhost:8008/).
